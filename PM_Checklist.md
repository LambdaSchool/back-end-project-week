[ ] - Share your board with the project manager that has been assigned to you. If you have not been assigned yet, reach out to your Section Lead for guidance.

## Backend MVP Features:

We recommend that you finish all the MVP features before trying to deploy.

[ ] - Add data persistenc using a Relational Database. We suggest you start with `SQLite3`.
[ ] - Create a Web API for the React application you built in the front-end project week.

  - Create a note with a _title_ and _content_.
  - View an existing note.
  - Edit an existing note.
  - Delete an existing note.
  - Modify your front-end so that it uses your newly created Web API.


## Deployment

[ ] - deploy your server to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction),
