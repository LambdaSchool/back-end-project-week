**2/12/19 notes**

Order: 

- Need to create a database and get it working in Postman before touching any of the front end. 

- Migrations: db needs to let you add notes. Notes have a `title` and some `content`. (Sure, make both `notNullable` while we're there.) Oh, and it'll need an `id`, obviously.
- Basically, need to have a lil CRUD app for your notes that you can play with in Postman.
- From there, I _think_ it'll just be swapping out the URLS in the Front-End Project Week repo to be my new `localhost` stuff?
- A stretch goal I'd really like to get to is just redoing the entire Front-End to make React less of a scary concept, but we'll... wait and see about that.
