# Lambda Notes as undertaken by Edd Burke

_https://lucid-minsky-dfb9d9.netlify.com/_

This is a project I've undertaken under the Lambda School backend development cirriculum. I have taken our previous React front end project and implemented a custom RESTful API, resplendent with full CRUD capability, which will allow a user to interact with the notes application. The backend API is deployed to Heroku and the front end interface is hosted with Netlify.

## API Endpoints

The CRUD endpoints follow:

**CREATE**
in which we create a note
_https://bummingsnotes.herokuapp.com/api/notes_

**READ**
in which we display a note
_https://bummingsnotes.herokuapp.com/api/notes_

**UPDATE**
in which we update a note
_https://bummingsnotes.herokuapp.com/api/notes/:id_

**DELETE**
in which we delete a note
_https://bummingsnotes.herokuapp.com/api/notes/:id_

## Extra Features

This project has met full MVP qualifications and has met the stretch goals of:

- Setup API Auto-Deploy on Heroku
- Setup front end deploy on Netlify
- Pagination for long lists of notes
- Implement authentication for registering and logging in / out users with JWT
- Create a readme for API interaction (_which you are reading now!_)
