## Tech Stack

Lambda Notes utilizes [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment, and is built in full stack JavaScript with a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) frontend, a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) backend, Blockstack's [Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia/blob/master/README.md) high-performance decentralized storage system is used to store notes in production, and a [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database in development.

### Rationale

#### Frontend
- netlify

- React

  - Blazing fast rendering with the virtual DOM
  - Robust developer tools for debugging
  - Component based structure maximizes reusablity and makes codebase more maintainable
  - Unidirectional data flow increases app performance and makes debugging easier
  - API friendly library works seamlessly with and is extendable across numerous frameworks to leverage advanced UI development

- Styled Components

  - Scopes styles to a component to avoid style leaks
  - Linters will show unused components so they can be removed
  - Source order independence eliminates the need to import files in a certain order
  - Compose new styles from existing components
  - Passing properties to the component allows for more flexibility

#### Backend

- heroku

- Node.js

  - Utilizes Google's V8 JS engine which is lightening fast, highly performant, and more scalable
  - Event loop allows non-blocking I/O operations which enhances speed of code execution
  - Integrates seamlessly with microservices architecture
  - Fullstack JS allows JS developers to work on both client and server sides potentially increasing productivity and saving money for startups

- Express

  - Includes numerous routing features and separate handlers for HTTP methods
  - Serves static files such as images and CSS / JS files
  - Integrates seamlessly with many popular template engine and NPM module plugins

## API

### Third Party API

[Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia)

  - Blockstack applications use the Gaia storage system to store data on behalf of a user. When the user logs in to an application, the authentication process gives the application the URL of a Gaia hub, which performs writes on behalf of that user. The Gaia hub authenticates writes to a location by requiring a valid authentication token, generated by a private key authorized to write at that location.

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api)

- Users can pay for the premium version of the serbvice. Stripe verifies and charges their credit card.

- [Blockstack](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js/blob/master/src/auth/README.md)
 - Users can sign up/log in using Blockstack's bearer token-based authentication system.

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Blockstack

Blockstack Authentication provides single sign on and authentication without third parties or remote servers. Blockstack Authentication is a bearer token-based authentication system. From an app user's perspective, it functions similar to legacy third-party authentication techniques that they're familiar with. For an app developer, the flow is a bit different from the typical client-server flow of centralized sign in services (e.g., OAuth). Rather, with Blockstack, the authentication flow happens entirely client-side.

### Payments

#### Stripe & Credits

Stripe is used to securely verify user credit cards and payments. After a user submits a payment, if it is successful, Stripe will send back a response the the payment is valid as well as an invoice that is saved to the database. Once this is complete, the user can access the premium features.
