# Back End Project Week

This is the backend server. Once you have cloned this application onto your workstation. CD into the root file of this project. Then run yarn dev ..you should see.. =Connected to 9000= 
This means that the backend server, which is what this application is, now is running on localhost:9000 

Once you have the backend server running. Clone the frontend application. This is the client side of the app. You will then CD into the root folder of the frontend application. From there, run yarn start in your terminal. This will run the client side on localhost:3000

ENJOY!!!
